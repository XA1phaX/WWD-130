      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Outdoor enthusiasts enjoy talking about their adventures, but sometimes it's hard to
bring up the topic with others who do not share our love for escaping civilization. I make shirts
that express our love for the uncommon and are great conversation starters for our experiences
in the outdoors. My websiteâ€™s purpose is to show others the adventure shirts that I make so that
they can express their love for the wilderness with others and have a really cool shirt that will
stand up to any of the adventures they choose to take it on.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience for this website is people who are interested in the outdoors. 
The age range of people I intend my website to be for is 16-40. My website will mainly be 
for displaying the shirts and hats that I make in order to allow my users to find out more about my shirt company. I intend 
the shirts to be for outdoorsy people and people interested in a more adventurous style of shirts and hats.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        My website is a place to display the products I sell, which include shirts and hats. People will come to my site 
        to learn more about my company and to view and purchase my products. The pages I will have on my website are, Home, 
        Products, and an About Us page. The header of the website will include links to these three pages, as well as have the 
        Untamed logo in the top left. The footer will also have links to all the pages, as well as legal information, such as copyright 
        and such. The footer will also include a link to our Instagram page, as well as a Facebook link.
      </p>
      <p>The homepage will consist of a large banner image with the company name or logo on top. The page will have a few images of 
        models wearing our shirts on the left and right of the page, as well as a little information about the company, and links to our 
        2 currently available products. It will also include any updates or information concerning future products. The majority of the 
        page will be images of our products being worn by models in either a gallery or set up in a grid. There will also be a section 
        that has a link to our Instagram page, as well as information about how to order products until we set up a way to buy them on 
        our website.</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Products</h3>
      <p>
        On the products page, I will have pictures of all available products, as well as the current prices. I would also like to 
        display the available sizes and colors in this section. Currently, I have 1 shirt available and 1 hat. The shirt I have 
        available is called &ldquo;Iceberg&rdquo; and has a large print of an iceberg on the back, as well as est. 2019 which is when I 
        started my company. On the front of the shirt, it has the Untamed logo. Currently, the shirt is available in short and long 
        sleeves, and the only available color at the moment is black. The hat I currently have available is a black snapback, with 
        the untamed logo embroidered on the front left side.
      </p>
      <p>Users will also be able to see products that are not released yet and sold out products on this page. This page will have 
        product images displayed for each product, as well as the product price and name below the image in a grid format. Each 
        product will say whether it is currently available or sold out. Products that are made to order will have a message stating 
        that it is not currently available, but orders are still accepted.</p>

      <h3>About Us</h3>

        company came to be, our established year, the reason we started the company, a picture of me, the owner and founder

        the company. Following those two paragraphs, I will have a picture of myself on the right-hand side of the page with a header 
        that says &ldquo;About the Founder&rdquo;, followed by some information about me and how I started the company as a student 
        at Brigham Young University Idaho. Following that, I will have a section that is titled &ldquo;Contact Us&rdquo; which will
