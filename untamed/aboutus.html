          <h3>How we got here</h3>
          <p id="aboutusP">
            We started in 2019, in the small college town of Rexburg Idaho. A
            young freshman student of Brigham Young University Idaho came up
            with an idea. That idea was to make t-shirts that not only looked
            good, but had designs that helped express peoples love for the
            outdoors. When coming up with a name for this new company, he
            thought long and hard to find a name with would encourage others to
            step out of the social norms and encourage others to be adventurous.
            One day, while still pondering the name, he overheard a stranger
            saying that others should live a more "tame" life. At that moment,
            he realized that he fundamentaly disagreed with the stranger. He
            wanted to encourage people to try new things, and rediscover the
            world outside of the typical 9-5, even if it is outside of the
            social norms. He wanted to encourage people to live their lives
            <b>UNATMED</b>. With that realization, Untamed Shirts was born.

          <h3>Our Mission</h3>
          <p id="ourMission">
            Our mission is to encourage others to discover the world, outside of
            the cubical and mundane routines of life by creating t-shirts that
            express the joy of adventure, the amazing things that the ourdoors
            can offer, and to inspire others to live life <b>UNTAMED</b>. We
            want to make sure that people are not only able to experience the
            world, but have a shirt that will keep up with all the new
            adventures they are destined to find.

          <h3>About the Founder</h3>
          <p id="aboutme">
            Born and raised in Southern California, Jackson Clarke, known by his
            friends as "JT", always is searching for his next adventure. He
            never felt like he "fit in" with the others around him. While others
            were focused on doing what society told them to do, he was always
            looking for something new, never satisfied with the thought of
            sacrificing his love for adventure for the approval of others. He
            wanted to show others that there is more to life than just doing
            what society expects of them. This desire led him down the path to
            create Untamed Shirts. He is currently still a student at BYU-Idaho,
            and is looking forward to the opportunity to continue his adventure
            of insiring others to live life <b>UNTAMED</b>.
